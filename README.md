# Robot-2019-Leds
Robot Leds for FRC Team 1080

# Functionality:
This is used with a FRC RoboRIO using the I2C bus. The Arduino acts as the I2C slave and the RIO as the master/server. 
The arduino looks for certain c++ char's that are sent from the RIO and changes the modes from there. 

# Modes:
Solid Red, Soild Green, Solid Blue, Color Wipe Green, Color Wipe Red, Rainbow, and more to come.
